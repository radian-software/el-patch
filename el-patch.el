;;; Commentary:

;; el-patch allows you to override Emacs Lisp functions in a
;; future-proof way. Specifically, you can override a function by
;; providing an s-expression-based "patch", from which the "original"
;; and "modified" definitions can both be computed -- just like a Git
;; patch.

;; The "modified" definition is what is actually evaluated in your
;; init-file, but at any time you can ask el-patch to look up the
;; actual definition of the function and compare it to the patch's
;; "original" definition. If there is a difference -- meaning that the
;; original function definition was updated since you created the
;; patch -- el-patch will show you with Ediff. This means you know
;; when you might need to update your customizations (this is the
;; future-proof part).

;; el-patch also provides a powerful mechanism to help you lazy-load
;; packages. If you want to use a function from a package without
;; triggering its autoload (for instance, activating a minor mode or
;; defining keybindings), you can just copy its definition to your
;; init-file and declare it as a patch. Then you can freely use the
;; function, but you will still be notified of updates to the original
;; definition by el-patch so you will know when to update your copy of
;; the definition.

;; Please see https://github.com/radian-software/el-patch for more
;; information.

;;; Code:

;; To see the outline of this file, run M-x outline-minor-mode and
;; then press C-c @ C-t. To also show the top-level functions and
;; variable declarations in each section, run M-x occur with the
;; following query: ^;;;;* \|^(

`:classify' - a function which may be called with a full
definition form (a list starting with e.g. `defun') and which
returns an alist detailing what it defines. In this alist, the
keys are symbols; only the values `function' and `variable' are
allowed. The values are names of functions and variables,
respectively, that are defined by the definition form. This
argument is mandatory.

`:locate' - a function which may be called with a full definition
form (a list starting with e.g. `defun') and which returns the
actual source code of the definition, as a list. If the patch
correct and up to date, then this will actually be the same as
the definition which was passed in. This argument is optional,
but required if you want patch validation to work.

`:declare' - a list to be put in a `declare' form of the
resulting `el-patch' macro, like:

    ((doc-string 2) (indent defun))

This argument is optional.

`:macro-name' - normally the name of the macro generated for
patching a `defun' is called `el-patch-defun', but you can
override that by providing this argument. This argument is
optional.

`:font-lock' - a function that can be called to set up font-lock
keywords (e.g., by calling `font-lock-add-keywords' with some
appropriate arguments). The function is called with one argument,
the macro name (e.g. `el-patch-defun')."

for the function, and verify that it is the same as the original
function assumed by the patch. A warning will be signaled if the
original definition for a patched function cannot be found, or if
there is a difference between the actual and expected original
definitions.

If multiple variants exist for the same patch, then select the
one specified by VARIANT (defaults to nil, like
`el-patch-variant'). For advanced usage only.

Interactively, use `completing-read' to select a function to
inspect the patch of.

NAME is a symbol naming the object being patched; TYPE is a
symbol `defun', `defmacro', etc.

Returns nil if the patch is not valid, and otherwise returns t.
If NOMSG is non-nil, does not signal a message when the patch is
valid.

If RUN-HOOKS is non-nil, runs `el-patch-pre-validate-hook' and
`el-patch-post-validate-hook'. Interactively, this happens unless
a prefix argument is provided.

See also `el-patch-validate-all'."
